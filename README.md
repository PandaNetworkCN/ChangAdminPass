Change admin password when UAC is enabled and control by LAPS


Why need this script to change password?

1. For security control, administrator password is generated by LAPS which is very complex and hard to type in.

2. For security control, UAC is enabled, LAPS password can't copy and paste in the admin pop windows.


This script can allow you paste LAPS password and open a cmd with admin access.
